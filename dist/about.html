                <p>How I Met Your Mother (often abbreviated to HIMYM) is an American sitcom created by 
                Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for CBS. The series follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and 
                his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in the year 
                2030, recounts to his son and daughter the events that led him to meet their mother.

                The series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New 
                York City. Among the 208 episodes, there were only four directors: Pamela Fryman (196 
                episodes), Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes) and Neil Patrick Harris.

                The show ran from 2005 to 2014. How I Met Your Mother is a joint production by Bays & 
                Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.

                Known for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic elements, How I Met 
                Your Mother has gained a cult following over the years while remaining popular throughout 
                its run. The show initially received positive reviews, while the later seasons received 
                more mixed reviews. The show was nominated for 30 Emmy Awards, winning ten. In 2010, 
                Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, 
                seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite 
                Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor.

                    <h3>Premise</h3>
                    The series concerns the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) narrating the
                    story of how he met the mother of his children. The story goes into a flashback and 
                    starts in 2005 with a 27-year-old Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an 
                    architect; the narrative deals primarily with his best friends, including the 
                    long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), 
                    womanizing-playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and news reporter Robin 
                    Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). The lives of all characters are entwined in each others. 
                    The series explores many storylines, including a "will they or won't they" relationship 
                    between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, 
                    and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.
                    <br><br>

                    The show's frame story depicts Ted (voice of Bob Saget, uncredited) verbally retelling 
                    the story to his son Luke (David Henrie) and daughter Penny (Lyndsy Fonseca) as they 
                    sit on the couch in the year 2030. This future-set frame is officially the show's 
                    "present day" and How I Met Your Mother exploits this framing device in numerous ways: 
                    to depict and re-depict events from multiple points of view; to set up jokes using 
                    quick and sometimes multiple flashbacks nested within the oral retelling; to substitute 
                    visual, verbal or aural euphemisms for activities Ted does not want to talk about with 
                    his children (sexual practices, use of illicit substances, vulgar language, etc.); and 
                    even to add some elements of humor: in the episode "How I Met Everyone Else", Ted 
                    describes his dates with a girlfriend whose name he has forgotten, leading all 
                    characters to act as though her given name were "Blah-Blah"; later in the series, Ted 
                    remembers her name as Carol.
                    <br><br>

                    While the traditional love-story structure begins when the romantic leads first 
                    encounter each other, How I Met Your Mother does not introduce Ted's wife (Cristin 
                    Milioti) until the eighth-season finale, and only announces her name (Tracy McConnell) 
                    during the series finale. The show instead focuses on Ted's prior relationships and his 
                    dissatisfaction with those women, thus setting the stage for his eventual happiness 
                    with Tracy. Finally in present 2030, six years after Tracy's death, Ted gets back with 
                    Robin, which viewers may have assumed at the series finale when Ted is standing outside 
                    Robin’s window. Ted’s children were the ones to realize first, that Ted was still in 
                    love with Robin, through the stories he told.</p>
